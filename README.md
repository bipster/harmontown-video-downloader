# Harmontown Video Downloader #

This is a rough script for downloading videos from the Harmontown.com website.

## Be Good

### Pay the subscription fee
You will need to supply credentials for an active subscription via a properties file; do not share/borrow them.

### Do not make this this multi-threaded
For the benefit of not just the community's but your own ability to download videos at a reasonable pace, [please respect](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harmontown/comments/d2dxnb/harmontown_is_ending/):
> "Planning on downloading everything? Make sure you have about 220GB of space available, and only download one file at a time to keep the server fast for everyone."
 
## Overview

* This is a Groovy script that requires Java be installed on your computer.  If you are on a Mac, this should work as-is.
* This will require more than 220GB of space available. (TODO: update with exact number)
* This requires an active subscription to [Harmontown.com](http://www.harmontown.com)
* If the script dies for some reason, you will be able to restart the script from where you left off; you will not have to start from scratch

## Running the Script
